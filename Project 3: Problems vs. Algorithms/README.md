## Project 3 - Problems vs. Algorithms

In this project, I completed seven tasks. The tasks covered a variety of topics related to the algorithms discussed in the course:
* Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer
* Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
* Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits
* Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem
* Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries
* Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array
* Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie
<br />
All tasks were completed using Python. 
<br />
Determined the time complexity and the space complexity (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of each solution.
