In Problem 2, Search in a Rotated Sorted Array, the requirement is that the time complexity must be in the order of O(log(n)). Therefore, the solution to this problem is implemented similarly to the binary search.

In this problem, we are given a sorted array which is rotated at some random pivot point. To check if either half of the given array is sorted, we compare if the start index is less than the middle or if the end index is greater than the middle. Next, once we determine the sorted half of the array, we examine whether the target number is in that sorted half by comparing it to the boundary values. We perform a binary search recursively within the sorted half of the array.

- The time complexity is O(log(n)) where n represents the number of elements.
- The space complexity is O(1) because we only store the middle_index and middle_element as integer values. The use of memory is independent of the input.
