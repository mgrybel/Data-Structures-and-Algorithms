In Problem 5, Autocomplete with Tries, a Trie, which is a tree-like data structure, is utilised to store a dynamic set of strings. There are two classes: TrieNode and Trie.

TrieNode insert:
- The time complexity and space complexity are both O(1) because a TrieNode is only added to the children list of a current node, which is a dictionary.

TrieNode suffixes:
- Here we have a recursive function that collects all suffixes for a given prefix and must traverse through each level until it reaches the end of a word. Therefore, the time complexity and space complexity are both O(mn), where m represents the number of elements within a level and n represents the depth of the level.

Trie insert:
- In order to insert, we must iterate through each character of the word and store the results as TrieNodes (children of the previous character). Therefore, the time complexity and space complexity are both O(n), where n represents the number of characters in a word.

Trie find:
- In order to find a given prefix, we must iterate through each character of the input and examine if that character is in the Trie. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).
- The space complexity is O(1) because we store only the current node.
