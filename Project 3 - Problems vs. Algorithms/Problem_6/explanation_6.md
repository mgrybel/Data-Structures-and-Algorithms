In Problem 6, Unsorted Integer Array, the requirement is that the time complexity must be in the order of O(n). In the proposed solution, the initial min and max values are set to the first value in a given array. Next, we iterate once through the array and subsequently adjust the values.

- The time complexity is O(n) because the given array is iterated only once and the min and max values are found in a single traversal.
- The space complexity is O(1) because there is no additional memory allocated.
