In Problem 4, Dutch National Flag Problem, a given array is sorted in one pass. The code uses variables to indicate where 0s end and 2s start. As a result, if either of these values is encountered in the array, the number is then swapped with whichever number was at that location. Using this method allows for sorting the array in a single traversal.

- The time complexity is O(n) where n represents the number of elements. The array is iterated through once.
- The space complexity is O(1) because we only store the start, end and current_index values. Sorting of the values is done in-place.
