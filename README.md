This repository contains all projects I prepared for the **Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree**.

## Project 1 - Unscramble Computer Science Problems
In this project, I completed five tasks. The tasks covered the analysis of a given dataset containing a set of calls and text messages.
<br />
All tasks were completed using Python. 
<br />
Determined the time complexity and the space complexity (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of each solution.

## Project 2 - Show Me the Data Structures
In this project, I completed six tasks. The tasks covered a variety of topics related to the data structures discussed in the course:
* Problem 1: Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache
* Problem 2: File Recursion
* Problem 3: Huffman Coding
* Problem 4: Active Directory
* Problem 5: Blockchain
* Problem 6: Union and Intersection
All tasks were completed using Python. 
<br />
Determined the time complexity and the space complexity (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of each solution.

## Project 3 - Problems vs. Algorithms
In this project, I completed seven tasks. The tasks covered a variety of topics related to the algorithms discussed in the course:
* Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer
* Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
* Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits
* Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem
* Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries
* Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array
* Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie
All tasks were completed using Python. 
<br />
Determined the time complexity and the space complexity (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of each solution.

## Project 4 - Route Planner
In this project, I built a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
<br />
The project was completed using Python.
<br />
Determined the time complexity and the space complexity (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of the proposed solution.
