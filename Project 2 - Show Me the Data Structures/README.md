## Project 2 - Show Me the Data Structures

In this project, I completed six tasks. The tasks covered a variety of topics related to the data structures discussed in the course:
* Problem 1: Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache
* Problem 2: File Recursion
* Problem 3: Huffman Coding
* Problem 4: Active Directory
* Problem 5: Blockchain
* Problem 6: Union and Intersection 
<br />
All tasks were completed using Python. 
<br />
Determined the time complexity and the space complexity (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of each solution.
