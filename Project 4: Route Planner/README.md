## Project 4 - Route Planner

In this project, I built a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
<br />
The project was completed using Python.
<br />
Determined the time complexity and the space complexity (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of the proposed solution.
