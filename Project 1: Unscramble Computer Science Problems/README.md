## Project 1 - Unscramble Computer Science Problems

In this project, I completed five tasks. The tasks covered the analysis of a given dataset containing a set of calls and text messages.
<br />
All tasks were completed using Python. 
<br />
Determined the time complexity and the space complexity (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of each solution.
