Project: Unscramble Computer Science Problems

This file contains a run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of my solutions to each of the problems.


##### Task0.py #####
Time Complexity: O(1)
This task takes constant time because the size of the input does not affect the run time.


##### Task1.py #####
Time Complexity: O(n)
In this task, the two lists (texts and calls) are looped through once each. Therefore, we have O(2n), which is then simplified to O(n).


##### Task2.py #####
Time Complexity: O(n)
In this task, the calls list is looped through once.


##### Task3.py #####
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
In this task, the time complexity of the for loop is O(n) and the time complexity of the Python sort (sorting the area codes) is, according to documentation found on https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity, O(n log n). Therefore, we have O(n + n log n), which is then simplified to O(n log n).


##### Task4.py #####
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
In this task, the time complexity of the for loop is O(n) and the time complexity of the Python sort (sorting possible telemarketers) is, according to documentation found on https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity, O(n log n). Therefore, we have O(n + n log n), which is then simplified to O(n log n).
